# Migrating Your Shopify Store to Sell on Telegram

Selling on Telegram can open up a new avenue for your Shopify store, allowing you to connect directly with your customers in a dynamic and interactive way. This guide will walk you through the steps to migrate your Shopify store to sell on Telegram using the Gramshop platform.

## Step 1: Export Your Products from Shopify

4. In the dialog box that appears, select `All products`.
5. Choose the `CSV for Excel, Numbers, or other spreadsheet programs` option.

3. Return to the Gramshop dashboard and create a new shop.
4. Drag and drop the product CSV you exported from Shopify.
5. Link the Telegram bot you created in the previous step to your Gramshop account.
